## Hi, I'm María! 👋  

I’m a **bioinformatics undergraduate** specializing in **genomics, statistical genetics, and computational biology**. My work involves analyzing large-scale genetic datasets to uncover biological insights, with a focus on **Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS)**, statistical modeling, and functional genomics. I use **R** and **Python** for data analysis, visualization, and machine learning applications in bioinformatics.

### 🔬 Research Focus:
- **Statistical Genomics** – Applying **Markov Chain Monte Carlo**, GWAS methodologies, and contingency table validation.
- **Functional Genomics** – Investigating SNPs using tools like **BLAST**, **FASTA**, and **RNAseq**.
- **AI in Bioinformatics** – Integrating genetic, environmental, and clinical data for predictive modeling.
- **Computational Biology** – Developing pipelines for large-scale genetic data processing.

### 🌱 Currently learning: 
- **Git & Github**

### 🛠️ Tools & Methods:
- **Programming**: Python, R, SQL, C++  
- **Statistical Analysis**: GWAS, MCMC, contingency tables  
- **Bioinformatics Tools**: BLAST, FASTA, RNAseq  
- **Data Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn, ggplot2  

### 🔭 Current Work:
- **Analyzing genetic and environmental interactions** in complex diseases.
- **Developing AI-driven models** to explore associations between genetic markers and disease risk.
- **Processing and integrating multi-omics datasets** for functional characterization.
- **Building computational pipelines** to automate genomic data analysis.
- **Working on informatics projects** as part of my university degree, integrating computational methods into biological research.
